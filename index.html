                * Graphic Design Jail * is a concept modified from the phrase “type jail” by a RISD professor who teaches typography. It represents the place that a “designer” will be sent to when they violate the * rules * of graphic design. (chuckles)<br>
                After learning how to make * good design * for years, I found myself really aware of the * right * logic/details of design pieces, made both by me and others. Thus, when one of my artist friends sketches out design-related work, I always provide my suggestions about how to make things right. Sometimes, I will joke with her by saying her work is * illegal * and I am going to send her to the “Graphic Design Jail” because she used a stretched Futura in her piece. (laughter with rolled eyes) I thought I was helping her until one day, she tell me that she is now so afraid of doing designs because she will always be * wrong *. This is the moment that I start reflecting on my persistence in following the graphic design rules: What’s the standard of right or wrong? And do we always need to make things right?<br>
                Then, I realize how * exclusive * graphic design rules are. Surely, that is what we spend this much time and money to learn in this major. And people say: you can absolutely break the rules, but ONLY after you get to know the rules. But is it healthy to keep graphic design to be * systematic *, exclusive and * unaccessible * to non-designers? No.<br>
                That is why in this degree project, I want to dive into those rules and try to acknowledge non-designers what the * rules * are, but let them decide what they WANT in the end. I will also take this project as a chance to break my boundar- ies by exploring “illegal” designs that can work.
